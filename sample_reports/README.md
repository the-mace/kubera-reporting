# Sample Reports

This directory contains example HTML reports generated from anonymized test data.

## Files

- **sample_report_first_day.html** - Report for the first day (no previous data, shows balances only)
- **sample_report_with_deltas.html** - Report for subsequent days (shows changes from previous day)

## How These Are Generated

These reports are automatically generated by running the test suite:

```bash
pytest tests/test_end_to_end.py::test_html_report_export -v
```

## Test Data

The reports use anonymized fixture data from:
- `tests/fixtures/snapshot_2025-01-15.json` (previous day)
- `tests/fixtures/snapshot_2025-01-16.json` (current day)

These fixtures contain:
- Net worth: ~$1.36M (fully anonymized)
- Realistic account types (brokerage, retirement, crypto, real estate, etc.)
- Daily changes mimicking real market movements
- No personally identifiable information
